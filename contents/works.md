  There is currently a lack of systematic analysis on how the combined effects of urban heat islands (UHI) and heatwaves (HW) differentially impact local climate and building energy use, especially regarding cross-scale responses between building clusters and individual buildings. To address this gap, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines the Urban Canopy Model (UCM) with the Urban Building Energy Model (UBEM). The framework evaluates the influence of UHI and urban morphology on local climate conditions, building energy consumption, and design-day loads during heatwaves at both cluster and individual building scales. By incorporating localized weather data (LWD) specific to each local climate zone (LCZ), the UBEM accounts for microclimate variations in simulations. This approach provides a practical tool for bottom-up modeling of extreme climate and UHI impacts on building energy risks, while also enabling quantification of compound UHI–HW effects on urban energy use and assessment of climate resilience in building clusters with varied morphological characteristics.

  <strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">An empirical study on the compound effects of extreme weather and UHI on building energy consumption under local climate</span></strong>

  Our study shows that localized weather data (LWD) better captures seasonal building energy use and the effects of external and internal factors. Compared to suburban weather station data, accuracy improves by 29.6% in summer and 36.6% in winter during the typical year, and by 35.1% and 30.1% during the extreme weather year, respectively. Local air temperature (Ta) has the greatest impact on actual energy use, followed by solar radiation (Rad)—especially during summer heatwaves, when Rad may exceed Ta in influence. Internal disturbances have a greater impact in summer, but their influence lessens during extreme weather due to stronger external climatic effects. This method supports refined assessment and control of UBEM across climates and seasons, helping manage energy peaks during heatwaves and prevent overheating in winter, ultimately aiding real-weather-based energy system optimization and urban design.

  <strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">A cross-scale indicator framework for the study of annual stability of land surface temperature in different land uses</span></strong>
</a>
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0;">–Year: 2024–</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; max-width: 100%; margin: 0;">
  This study aims to address two city-scale scientific questions: First, what local environmental factors contribute to differences in ΔLST between the same land use types? Second, how much does the phenological variation between winter and summer in different local urban environments affect annual LST fluctuations? To answer these questions, we established a cross-scale indicator framework to analyze the spatial environmental characteristics of urban areas with significant and minimal annual LST fluctuations across various land uses. Based on the identified adverse urban spaces, we propose local improvement strategies to tackle urban surface heat islands and extreme climate challenges. These strategies help balance land economic benefits with urban climate resilience.

  <strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Coupling effects of building-vegetation-land on seasonal land surface temperature on street-level</span></strong>

<p style="font-size: 18px; max-width: 100%; margin: 0;">
  We propose a "vegetation-building-land" trinity framework for analyzing urban elements, comprehensively evaluating the impact of both morphological and non-morphological characteristics on the annual stability of street LST. Secondly, we emphasize the impact of vegetation and land elements, as well as non-morphological characteristics, on winter street LST. Thirdly, we have addressed the annual amplitude or fluctuation in LST at the street-level, clarifying the impact of urban elements on its different aspects. Finally, based on the annual weights of these characteristics, we developed systematic and comprehensive strategies.

  <strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">The effects of street environment features on road running</span></strong>

<p style="font-size: 18px; max-width: 100%; margin: 0;">
  The study proposes a nonparametric approach that uses machine learning models to predict road running intensity. The models were developed using route check-in data from Keep, a mobile exercise application, and street geographic information data from Beijing's core district. The results show that, for inland cities, blue spaces remain the most important factor in increasing road running intensity. The non-linear relationship between street environment features and road running intensity was investigated, and design guidelines were provided.
