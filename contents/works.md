  There is currently a lack of systematic analysis on how the combined effects of urban heat islands (UHI) and heatwaves (HW) differentially impact local climate and building energy use, especially regarding cross-scale responses between building clusters and individual buildings. To address this gap, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines the Urban Canopy Model (UCM) with the Urban Building Energy Model (UBEM). The framework evaluates the influence of UHI and urban morphology on local climate conditions, building energy consumption, and design-day loads during heatwaves at both cluster and individual building scales. By incorporating localized weather data (LWD) specific to each local climate zone (LCZ), the UBEM accounts for microclimate variations in simulations. This approach provides a practical tool for bottom-up modeling of extreme climate and UHI impacts on building energy risks, while also enabling quantification of compound UHI–HW effects on urban energy use and assessment of climate resilience in building clusters with varied morphological characteristics.

  Our study shows that LWD better captures seasonal building energy use and the effects of external and internal factors. Compared to suburban weather station data, accuracy improves by 29.6% in summer and 36.6% in winter during the typical year, and by 35.1% and 30.1% during the extreme weather year, respectively. Local air temperature (Ta) has the greatest impact on actual energy use, followed by solar radiation (Rad)—especially during summer heatwaves, when Rad may exceed Ta in influence. Internal disturbances have a greater impact in summer, but their influence lessens during extreme weather due to stronger external climatic effects. This method supports refined assessment and control of UBEM across climates and seasons, helping manage energy peaks during heatwaves and prevent overheating in winter, ultimately aiding real-weather-based energy system optimization and urban design.
